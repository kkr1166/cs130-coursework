<!--                    <p>A cat copes with loss through music and unexpected companionship in this heartwarming animation.</p>-->
                    <p>The animator injured his wrist playing basketball recently, so production is on hold for at least a few more weeks. In the draft above, the music is finished, but the animation will eventually be much clearer and in color.</p><br>
                    <h2>Synopsis</h2>
                    <p>A cat is adopted by a grandmother. The cat is naive, hence the fall from the cat tower and the surprise when he first hears the piano. He is curious too, and slowly approaches the piano. The grandmother teaches him to play, and they bond through music.</p> <br>
                    <p>After some time passes, the grandmother leaves. The reason is likely related to her old age. The cat is adopted by the grandmotherâ€™s daughter and grandchild. The cat is grieving and struggling to adjust to the new home. The cat finds out that the kid plays keyboard. The cat tries to teach the kid the tune he learned from the grandmother. Turns out that the kid knows the tune and starts to harmonize.</p>
